# about me
Hey, I'm Tarun. <br><br>I'm a student of Information Science and Psychology at the University of Maryland. I have a large amount of interest in exploring Cybersecurity, cloud engineering and data science. I love creating my own projects that implement a philosophy of prioritizing cohesive UX/UI, while maintaining efficiency and performance. <br><br>I am constantly working on a large number of side projects and experiments, changes are only committed on GitHub when l make significant progress.<br><br>In my free time I love tinkering, horror games, reading, movies, working on my music and obsessing over my cat.
